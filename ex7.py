print "Mary had a little lamb."
print "Its fleece as white as %s." % 'snow' # I wonder what happens If I write  "snow' open with " and end with '. Lets see about that later first lets finish typing.
# print "snow' this doesnt work. EOL error. I am guessing End Of Line = EOL

print "And everywhere that Mary went."
print "." * 10 # What does this do? Prints out 10 dots. kind of weird. Its a charater but when you use mathematical operations on it it multiplies it 10 times. i wonder whether it can be stored in a variable?. Yes this can be done. Quite weird That we can do number operations on something that is not a number.

test = "a" * 10
print test

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "b"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6, # adds up the individual strings/ characters in this case to produce a nice word like cheese :P  However the comma ensures that the values are printed in the same line. We ould have also used a single print statement to do the job. Apparently a python code over 80 lines is bad practice. It is weird that It includes a space in between the two prints. I am guessing that when you want to print output in the same line it is automatically spearated by a space. 
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
